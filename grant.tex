\begin{abstract}
Rock Paper Scissors is one of the most recognizable, easy, and popular hand games out there. And while it is sometimes fun to play as a last resort in an incredibly boring situation, winning roughly 50\% of the time isn't good enough for us. We want to not only win, but crush the competition. Humans are terrible at being random, and we want to make a robotic hand to exploit this human weakness.

Our main goal for this semester project is to make a robotic hand that will beat humans at rock paper scissors. Using OpenCV and some basic electronics parts, we want to have a basic robotic hand that can recognize a pattern from a human in rock paper scissors, and exploit it to crush them, in the game.
